		<p> I was confused as to how one can tar file all of the files from a repository which is a requirement of the program for the 2nd stipend. I clicked a random 2017 DREU participants website. I noticed that she used a github repository as her host. I saw that she left her contact information on the web page and decided to reach out. Why not, right? The worst that’ll happen is that she wouldn’t respond. She responded immediately. “Okay, so if you have a Mac, go where you store the folder with all your website documents. Do you know how to use terminal? If so, change to the location where this folder is, and run this command: tar czf folder_name.tar folder_name This will create a tar file of all your documents.” This was incredibly helpful. Thank you Sarah! <b>Lessons Learned (before stepping foot in WA):</b> Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Reach out to others when you are unsure of something and have Google searched yourself. Try new things, even if they are scarily full of code.

		<p> Well, my official first blog begins as I just moved to Seattle from Pennsylvania. After taking 3 trips to Target, Safeway and Walgreens on my move-in day, I recommend that when you plan for a temporary move and you think you have planned your packing lists enough, continue to plan/pack more! At the airport for my 5:40am EST flight, my two suitcases weighed in at 45 lbs each...little did I know, that wouldn’t be enough. Stay awake as long as possible on your first day of a dramatic time change. Don’t knock yourself down for being tired in the first few days of that time change because your body needs to adjust.

			<p> <b>Moving to UW:</b> At the University of Washington, the gym allowed me to be a “Special Circumstance” to obtain a student gym membership for the summer at only $87 (which, believe it or not, is very affordable in this town). After prior research and an email from my professor/research mentor to the UW Rec Center (recinfo@uw.edu), I was able to obtain this pass. Mental and physical health, as well as wellbeing is important to maintain throughout the summer! Also, Seattle is quite cold at night in June. It drops to around 50 degrees every night. And, coming from someone who only packed sheets and no comforter/blanket for the summer, pack or mail a comforter!
			</p>
<p> <b>Research:</b> As expected, a ton of amazing work is not only being done in the DUB group at the University of Washington which combines the iSchool, Human Centered Design and Engineering department, the design department and the Computer Science department, but just within the lab of my research mentor, Dr. Julie Kientz. Thus, after discussing a summer plan, I didn’t quite choose one specific project since so many projects appealed to my diverse interests in health, design, innovation and family informatics. She has several incredible students and I spent the first two days reading their most recent papers to further assess my interest in their projects including: Incloodle, BabySteps and Family Sleep Informatics. Additionally, on my first day, I had the opportunity to attend Dr. Daniel Epstein’s defense talk on Everyday Personal Informatics. This was especially interesting to me because of my passion for the technologies that allow consumers to track and share their data from weight loss journeys to running maps. Attend talks and sessions whenever you can.

		<p> <b>Weekend:</b> This past weekend, I went to the University District Farmers Market, which is held weekly on Saturday’s from 9am-2pm. Additionally, I finally had the opportunity to visit the Amazon Go store to see cutting edge technology at work and checked out Pike Place Market and the surrounding area!

<p> <b>Research:</b> Throughout my first full week, I explored a research topic that I’d like to work on this summer, surrounding the presence of sociable robots in family homes with children aged 4-12. Previous work seems to not focus on low SES populations and I’m interested in the way that those families interact with the devices at home, and how they feel about the possibility of their children anthropomorphizing Alexa or Jibo at a young age. I’m interested in exploring parent’s perspective on privacy with AI devices throughout their home and how invasive they are willing to allow sociable robots to be in the home of young children. I began considering several research questions and how we might answer them this summer. Additionally, I had the opportunity to learn more about Dr. Laura Pina’s family sleep research by attending an analysis meeting with her team. I wish her the best of luck in her new position at Google.

Fun Fact of the Week: More than 75% of positive Amazon reviewers of Jibo, the fun, sociable robot of the future, call the robot a “friend,” “part of the family,” or “great company for those living alone.” You can bring Cynthia Breazeal’s brain child Jibo home for only $699, with a current Amazon coupon! And if you’d like, send me one too :)

		<p> <b>Weekend:</b> This past weekend, I went on a 7 mile bike ride (the longest of my life) to Bellevue, WA. Pro Tip: Bring Water. Also, if you make trip, do it on a real bike and not a bike-share bike. There simply aren’t enough gears for all of the hills. The bridge over Lake Washington was very long! There is an awesome movie theatre, Cinemark Reserve, in which you can watch the movie from a recliner with full-service restaurant and bar available from the chair! I went to see Incredibles 2. It was awesome. If you don’t have plenty to spend at Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc., I don’t recommend walking to the Shops at the Bravern. But, there is a huge mall called the Bellevue Collection, that is very typical and has a ton of shops. There are a few good restaurants around the mall and I ate dinner at Lot No. 3 which had awesome sliders (Pb&J &Bacon Slider and a Gruyere Cheeseburger Slider on happy hour :) On Saturday, I biked down to the South Lake Union Saturday Market. There were tons of tasty vendors. But, I biked down and trusted Google maps too thoroughly and had a bike accident. On Sunday, I went to the Portage Bay Cafe for brunch. It was AMAZING. They have a berry bar! 10/10- would reccomend. 
		<p> <b>Research:</b> In meeting with Dr. Kientz, early this week, we discussed several ideas for where I want to go with my research questions and what methods I can use to test them. Since there is already a Mozilla-funded research study in-action, involving the deployment of Echo devices in family homes, I will simply add on several of my research questions to the post-interview. I hope to also build an online survey to fill in the gaps in our research questions and make up for limitations in the survey. Hopefully, this survey will help researchers and tech designers understand the perspectives of parents opinions regarding the benefits and burdens of technology in the home. Also, we discussed how ideal/ fundable research should lie in Pasteur’s quadrant, as visible in the image below from Openeducationresearch.org. Additionally, I was excited and applied for various funding/opportunities to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. I hope it works out. I would truly appreciate the opportunity to engage in conversation with such incredible women. This week, I went to a Personal Informatics meeting with other undergraduates as well. Also, I had the incredible opportunity to take a research field trip into the actual field with a Senior Researcher at Mozilla. It was so surreal to do work that I’d love to do in the future. I truly enjoyed interacting with the participant, spending the day with them, and thinking about research questions similar to my own. I learned a lot and look forward to opportunities like that in the future. Thank you Janice and Mozilla! </p>
			<p> <b>Not so Fun Fact of the Week:</b> There were 1,205 reported bicycle accidents in 2017 according to the Washington State Department of Transportation, 504 of which occured in King County, which includes Seattle and is the 13-th most populous county in the U.S. So, wear a helmet and don’t trust Google maps blindly.
