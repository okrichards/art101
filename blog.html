		<p> This summer, I had the unique opportunity to study Dr. Julie Kientz at the University of Washington, in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. Dr. Kientz studies Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics and is passionate about the intersection of those fields with healthy living and learning. We conducted research on digital user experience to reduce the opportunity gap for low-to-middle income families and took a mixed methods approach. Over my ten week experience that was funded by the Computing Research Association, I helped conduct semi-structured initial and final interviews with 10 families and introduced digital voice assistant technology into their homes. As part of another project, I scraped, filtered, and analyzed relevant product reviews in a content analysis to understand perspectives and share design opportunities for voice assistants to support all families

		<p> Thus, as part of my Art 101 blog for this fall 2018 semester, I'd like to discuss a few of my interesting observations that I had this summer, both related and unrelated to my research. The first of which being the culture of recycling in Seattle.
