		<p> This summer, I had the unique opportunity to study Dr. Julie Kientz at the University of Washington, in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. Dr. Kientz studies Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics and is passionate about the intersection of those fields with healthy living and learning. We conducted research on digital user experience to reduce the opportunity gap for low-to-middle income families and took a mixed methods approach. Over my ten week experience that was funded by the Computing Research Association, I helped conduct semi-structured initial and final interviews with 10 families and introduced digital voice assistant technology into their homes. As part of another project, I scraped, filtered, and analyzed relevant product reviews in a content analysis to understand perspectives and share design opportunities for voice assistants to support all families

		<p> Thus, as part of my Art 101 blog for this fall 2018 semester, I'd like to discuss a few of my interesting observations that I had this summer, both related and unrelated to my research. The first of which being the culture of recycling in Seattle.

		<p> Summer research at the University of Washington has given me the unique opportunity to spend 10 weeks in the progressive city of Seattle. So many news stories from the summer gave me hope for Mother Earth.
			</p>
		<p> On <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seattle-ban-on-plastic-straws-goes-into-effect-july-1/">July 1</a>- Seattle became the first city to ban single use straws, stirrers and utensils. On <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/starbucks-to-ditch-single-use-plastic-straws-by-2020.html">July 9</a>- Starbucks will ditch single use plastic straws in all cafes by 2020. And on <a href= "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/mcdonalds-and-starbucks-team-up-to-develop-a-more-sustainable-cup.html">July 17</a>- Starbucks and Mcdonalds have joined forces to create a compostable cup. 
			</p>
		<p>On a hot Saturday afternoon, I sat at a burger joint near the receptacle area. Families stand near the receptacle area with a blank stare. One family was completely confused- I was too close to not provide some help. I explained how to properly dispose of everything from their meal. They thanked me for helping with a smile and sigh of relief. After a bit more research, I realized that even I MESSED UP. The Coca-Cola paper cup, that I thought was lined with plastic, is actually recyclable! See, it happens to the best of us. The confusion was shocking. I then proceeded to watch the process closely as four or five more tables got up to dispose of the scraps from their meal. One man grabbed items from his child and shoved them in the garbage in an “I don’t care”-type of fashion. Others assumed everything was recyclable and tossed everything, including compostable materials, into the large recycling can, an aspirational recycler, tossing it in out of sheer hope. Another family painstakingly stared at each product, each of the three bins and the restaurant's custom signage for each can, which led to success.

		<p> Next week, I plan to discuss next steps for recycling across America and specifically here in State College. Until then, think about the ways that you recycle?
