		<p> This summer, I had the unique opportunity to study Dr. Julie Kientz at the University of Washington, in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. Dr. Kientz studies Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics and is passionate about the intersection of those fields with healthy living and learning. We conducted research on digital user experience to reduce the opportunity gap for low-to-middle income families and took a mixed methods approach. Over my ten week experience that was funded by the Computing Research Association, I helped conduct semi-structured initial and final interviews with 10 families and introduced digital voice assistant technology into their homes. As part of another project, I scraped, filtered, and analyzed relevant product reviews in a content analysis to understand perspectives and share design opportunities for voice assistants to support all families

		<p> Thus, as part of my Art 101 blog for this fall 2018 semester, I'd like to discuss a few of my interesting observations that I had this summer, both related and unrelated to my research. The first of which being the culture of recycling in Seattle.

		<p> Summer research at the University of Washington has given me the unique opportunity to spend 10 weeks in the progressive city of Seattle. So many news stories from the summer gave me hope for Mother Earth.
			</p>
		<p> On <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seattle-ban-on-plastic-straws-goes-into-effect-july-1/">July 1</a>- Seattle became the first city to ban single use straws, stirrers and utensils. On <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/06/starbucks-to-ditch-single-use-plastic-straws-by-2020.html">July 9</a>- Starbucks will ditch single use plastic straws in all cafes by 2020. And on <a href= "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/mcdonalds-and-starbucks-team-up-to-develop-a-more-sustainable-cup.html">July 17</a>- Starbucks and Mcdonalds have joined forces to create a compostable cup. 
			</p>
		<p>On a hot Saturday afternoon, I sat at a burger joint near the receptacle area. Families stand near the receptacle area with a blank stare. One family was completely confused- I was too close to not provide some help. I explained how to properly dispose of everything from their meal. They thanked me for helping with a smile and sigh of relief. After a bit more research, I realized that even I MESSED UP. The Coca-Cola paper cup, that I thought was lined with plastic, is actually recyclable! See, it happens to the best of us. The confusion was shocking. I then proceeded to watch the process closely as four or five more tables got up to dispose of the scraps from their meal. One man grabbed items from his child and shoved them in the garbage in an “I don’t care”-type of fashion. Others assumed everything was recyclable and tossed everything, including compostable materials, into the large recycling can, an aspirational recycler, tossing it in out of sheer hope. Another family painstakingly stared at each product, each of the three bins and the restaurant's custom signage for each can, which led to success.

		<p> Next week, I plan to discuss next steps for recycling across America and specifically here in State College. Until then, think about the ways that you recycle?

		<p> Last week, I discussed my recycling concerns and hopes and now, I'd like to think about next steps for recycling across America and specifically here in State College. </p>
		<p> So what's the next step, recycling education? Frequent articles by newspapers? required "look up" tools by town or city? Do you think it should be the responsibility of individual restaurants to create proper signage for customers to follow? Decrease in bin size to avoid an unsorted attitude? I'm not sure. But, what I am sure of is that other states and municipalities need to make this process simpler.
			</p>
		<p> I moved into an apartment this year, off-campus. The State College recycling system is unreal. Everything must be separated and the apartment buildings have single cans outside of the buildings. So, you have to have the patience to separate everything or purchase several cans for the inside of your building that you would separate later on. This was absolutely insane. They have 3 cans for different colored glass! This process truly discourages students from recycling and encourages them to throw everything in the trash. Considering the immense college student population in State College, something needs to be done to replicate the Penn State recycling process here and make things more stream-lined.

		 In talking about my summer experience, I'd also love to share my thoughts on one of the events that made me more confident that I could be selected to participate in the Computing Research Association's DREU program to enable me to work at the University of Washington. Last semester, I frequently got stir fry from the Mongolian Grill at Redifer Dining. I also frequently took a fortune cookie with my meal. One day, I got one that told me something that linked to this experience.
According to NPR on July 25, 2013, a Massachusetts man ate Chinese food and his fortune cookie message predicted he would win a lot of gold, he decided that the next day would be the best time to a lottery ticket and he won the million-dollar prize. While there are many stories like this, is it right to believe in something so fake?
I  read a list of crowdsourced rules of the cookie and I apparently can't tell you my fortune.
On that day, I received a fortune that relates to my summer research hopes. I hung it on my cork board of photos from college (for good luck, I thought). I read this message after developing plans to do research at the University of Washington during summer 2018. But, like many college students, I couldn't go anywhere without funding. I applied Early Decision on December 20th for an REU grant/program from a prestigious computing organization and didn't hear back until March.  In the mean time, my nervousness and lack of belief in 'the cookie' has sent me to apply to a few other REU programs for the summer, with some in the westwardly direction.
I nervously checked my email every 10 minutes, and I continued to think to myself, should I believe in this cookie? Because I wanted to! But, I also believe that everything happens for a reason. I felt that this opportunity to work with a renowned professor at the #1 university in the country for my research area would change the game with my graduate school applications. If I'm meant to go, I'm meant to go.  
At the end of the day, we must also be incredibly thankful for the opportunities that we have been presented with. So, do you believe?
Believing in fortune cookies worked for me and I was selected and had a fantastic experience.
