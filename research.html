		    This summer Sarah will be working for the SCIPR project in the Articulab at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, teaching revolves around examinations instead of developing a general problem solving attitude and approach. Curiosity could be mediated to help students to reason and understand problems. SCIPR plans to connect bring technology into the classroom to help students develop these skills through multi-party cooperative gameplay. Sarah will be working on a way for a virtual agent to understand game rules and to autonomously develop a strategy while considering verbal behavior.
