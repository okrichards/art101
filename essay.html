		    <strong>Parents, Kids and Technological Agents </strong> 
<p> Parents often receive conflicting information on the benefits and burdens of children's technology use, especially when it comes to novel technologies such as digital home assistants. To gain insight as to the current research in this area, I have conducted a literature review of the existing bodies of work regarding children's use of digital assistants and social robots in the home.	
</p>
<p> Human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers have shown that many families are incorporating digital home assistants in their family living environment with children at a young age [2, 5, 7], as well as older adults [11]. Voice is considered a preferable method for information seeking and entertainment control when your body or hands are occupied (i.e. driving, exercising, biking, cooking, crafting). As voice technologies continue to improve, voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Google Now, and Cortana are becoming everyday friends [9] to many consumers, but a source of confusion to others. Voice interfaces are an ever growing technological realm that are often missing from the homes of low-to-middle income American families. In fact, according to Rakuten Intelligence, over 50% of Amazon Echo buyers have an annual household income over $75,000 per year [1]. The average Echo user spent $400 more than the average Amazon Prime member [4] in 2017, showing that Echo owners are a generally affluent user base. Thus, children living in low-to-middle-income homes often don’t have the opportunity to explore or be empowered by cutting-edge voice technologies.
					</p>
<p> Several digital home assistants have been developed for consumers. The popularity of devices like the Amazon Echo provides new opportunities to study how people use and perceive conversational agents. Researchers have examined children's perception of intelligent personal assistants with respect to intelligence, abilities and trust, including Amazon Echo and Google Home [2]. Luger et al. studied user expectations of conversational agents, including Siri, Google, and Alexa, and found user expectations far more complex than the rather simple operation of the systems, particularly regarding known machine intelligence, system capability and goals [5].
  </p>
<p> Researchers have become creative with methods of data collection in order to understand how families use technology in their natural environment, as their are challenges that emerge in doing research in participant homes [12]. Researchers gained insight into family technology practices in their multi-screen living rooms using a camera to detect TV and smartphone usage [10]. Ferdous et al. [3] also leveraged video capture for data collection, along with frequent home visits to track technology use during family mealtime. Porcheron et al. [7] deployed Amazon Echo devices with a general population of participants, as well as a Conditional Voice Recorder, that activated when the "wake word" Alexa is heard by the Echo. In my summer 2018 research, we took a similar approach in leveraging a conditional voice recorder that records a longer period of time to understand the context of conversations surrounding the device.
    </p>
<p> Several researchers have leveraged Amazon Echo reviews to gain insights into user perceptions and use of the devices, but the parent perspective is still under-explored. Purington et al. studied the way that users personified their Echo device in Amazon reviews, and concluded that users who personify their Echo device are more likely to be generally satisfied with it [9]. Pradhan et al. examined the accessibility of digital home assistants off-the-shelf and studied how voice-based intelligent personal assistants are being used by people with disabilities, by analyzing Amazon Echo reviews by users with disabilities and interviewing disabled users of the Amazon Echo [8]. The researchers found that, although there are accessibility challenges, consumers with varying disabilities are using the Amazon Echo for speech therapy and to support their family and friend caregivers. The depth and breath of Amazon Echo product reviews provides an opportunity to learn what families perceive as the benefits and burdens of their Echo devices.				
		</p>		
</p>Researchers have worked to understand child and parent-child interaction with internet connected toys in the lab setting. Druga et al. [2] studied how 26 children interacted with and perceived their compared intelligence to several digital home assistants and smart toys, and found that differing modes of interaction can affect this level of intelligence. Several parent perspectives of the toys were confirmed in our Amazon review content analysis as they wished for more parental controls and were concerned for jokes that weren’t age-appropriate [6]. 
</p>
<p> Researchers are studying the ways that Echo devices could be better designed to support parent-child and child-only interactions with digital home assistants. Since almost all previous research was conducted in the lab setting, in my lab at the University of Washington this summer, we studied everyday interactions for families. Through our work, we study how families adopt digital home assistants, how they interact with them, and what specific benefits and burdens they encounter.
